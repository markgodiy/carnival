# Comments
Both PowerShell and Python support commenting code for documentation and readability purposes. In PowerShell, comments are denoted with the "#" symbol, while in Python they are denoted with the "#" symbol as well as multi-line comments which start with a set of triple quotes.

Sure, here are some more in-depth examples of comments in PowerShell and Python:

1. Single-Line Comments:

In PowerShell, you can add a single-line comment by using the `#` character. Here's an example:

```
# This is a single-line comment in PowerShell
```

In Python, you can also add a single-line comment using the `#` character. Here's an example:

```
# This is a single-line comment in Python
```

2. Multi-Line Comments:

In PowerShell, you can add a multi-line comment by using the `

```
<# This is a
multi-line comment
in PowerShell #>
```

In Python, you can add a multi-line comment by enclosing your comment in triple quotes. Here's an example:

```
'''
This is a
multi-line comment
in Python
'''
```

3. Documenting Functions:

In PowerShell, you can document your functions using special comment blocks called "comment-based help." Here's an example:

```
<#
.SYNOPSIS
This function multiplies two numbers together.

.DESCRIPTION
This function takes two integer parameters and returns their product.

.PARAMETER num1
The first integer to multiply.

.PARAMETER num2
The second integer to multiply.

.EXAMPLE
Multiply-Numbers -num1 5 -num2 10

Returns 50.

#>
function Multiply-Numbers {
    param(
        [int]$num1,
        [int]$num2
    )
    return $num1 * $num2
}
```

In Python, you can document your functions using docstrings, which are enclosed in triple quotes. Here's an example:

```
def multiply_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    This function multiplies two numbers together.

    Args:
    num1 (int): The first integer to multiply.
    num2 (int): The second integer to multiply.

    Returns:
    int: The product of num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 * num2
```

Note that in both PowerShell and Python, comments and documentation are essential for making your code more readable and maintainable. By adding comments to your code, you can explain what it does, why it does it, and how it works, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and modify the code in the future.
