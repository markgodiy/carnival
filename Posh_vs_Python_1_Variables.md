# Variables and Data Types

Both PowerShell and Python use variables to store data. In PowerShell, variables are denoted with a "$" symbol and can hold any type of data. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning they don't require explicit declarations, and their data type is inferred from the value assigned to them.

## **Variables:**
<br>
In PowerShell, variables are denoted with a "$" symbol and can be assigned values like this:

```
$name = "John"
$age = 30
```

In Python, variables don't require explicit declaration and can be assigned values like this:

```
name = "John"
age = 30
```

## **Data Types**
<br>
PowerShell and Python both support several data types, including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans. Here are some examples of how to declare and use these data types in each language:
<br>

### Strings:

In PowerShell, you can declare a string variable like this:

```
$name = "John"
```

In Python, you can declare a string variable like this:

```
name = "John"
```

- Integers:

In PowerShell, you can declare an integer variable like this:

```
$age = 30
```

In Python, you can declare an integer variable like this:

```
age = 30
```

- Floating-Point Numbers:

In PowerShell, you can declare a floating-point number variable like this:

```
$pi = 3.14159
```

In Python, you can declare a floating-point number variable like this:

```
pi = 3.14159
```

- Booleans:

In PowerShell, you can declare a boolean variable like this:

```
$is_enabled = $true
```

In Python, you can declare a boolean variable like this:

```
is_enabled = True
```

Note that in Python, the boolean values are capitalized (i.e. True and False), whereas in PowerShell they are lowercased (i.e. $true and $false). Additionally, in Python, you can use numerical values to represent boolean values (i.e. 0 for False and non-zero for True), but this is not recommended.
